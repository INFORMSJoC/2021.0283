This program is an implementation of the benchmark generator in the paper "Aircraft conflict resolution:  A benchmark generator", written by Mercedes Pelegrín and Martina Cerulli.
In particular, this program is to produce testing instances of the Tactical Deconfliction (TD) problem in the context of Air Traffic Management, also known as aircraft Conflict Detection and Resolution, or just Conflict Resolution.

-------------------- COMPILATION -----------------------------------
In order to compile, type:

g++ generator-TD.cpp -o generator

-------------------- HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM ------------------------
To run the program, type:

./generator [FLAG] [value]

In the following, we list the different flags that can be used with their associated values with the format:

FLAG	[value] [default_value]

The coordinates of initial positions of aircraft are represented with the following notation:
    (x0,y0,z0)=(radius*cos(theta)*sin(phi),radius*sin(theta)*sin(phi),radius*cos(phi))) for 3D instances,
    (x0,y0)=(radius*cos(theta), radius*sin(theta)) for 2D instances.
See M. Pelegrín and M.Cerulli (2021) "A tactical deconfliction instances generator", for more details.

-------------------- REMARKS --------------------------------------

* In grid problems alpha will be set to M_PI/2 (i.e. 90°), in cubic problems both alpha and beta will be set to M_PI/2 (i.e. 90°).
* In polyhedral/cubic instances it is possible to insert a different value of mx, my, mz, alpha, alphad, beta, betad for each horizontal plane. 
For example the user could type: ./generator -mode PL -HP 3 -VP 2 -mx 2 3 5 -my 1 -alphad 45 60 100 -beta 3.14159
The corresponding scenario will be polyhedral, with 3 horizontal planes and 2 vertical planes. The first horizontal plane will have 2 horizontal trails and 1 slopping trail with a slope of 45°. The second horizontal plane will have 3 horizontal trails and 2 vertical trails (default value, since the user inserted only one value for my) with a slope of 60°. The third horizontal plane will have 5 horizontal trails and 2 vertical trails (default value) with a slope of 100°. The first vertical plane will have 2 vertical trails (default value, since the user inserted no value for mz) with a slope of M_PI. Finally, the last vertical plane will have 2 vertical trails (default value) with a slope of 2*M_PI/3  (default value, since the user inserted only one value for beta).
* In polyhedral/cubic instances, each of the options dx, dy, dz, nx, ny, and nz, corresponds to a single value, which will be the same for every horizontal/vertical plane.

-------------------- OUTPUT FORMAT ---------------------------

The program will produce 2 files:

1) instance.dat: contains the list of initial positions p0=(x0,y0,z0), and vectors of velocities of the aircraft (either in polar coordinates V_polar=(v,theta,phi) or in Cartesian coordinates V=(Vx,Vy,Vz)=(v*cos(theta)*sin(phi),v*sin(theta)*sin(phi),v*cos(phi))

2) Figure.tex: LaTeX code (TikZ) for a graphical representation of the instance in a Cartesian coordinate system, i.e. initial positions and vectors of velocities of the aircraft. The pairs in conflict, and the number of conflicts for each aircraft are reported as well. Each aircraft trajectory is represented with different colors. Use LaTeX compiler to generate a .pdf with the corresponding figure. You might need to change 'scale' in \begin{tikzpicture} [scale=...] for a proper visualization.


Additional information on the generated instance can be found as output:
- Pairs in conflict
- Distance at the time of minimal separation
- Duration of conflict
- Number of conflicts per aircraft
- Proportion of aircraft with at least one conflict
- Proportion of pairs of conflicts
